# Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is a package manager and a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) graduated project that provides a way to easily find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.

* Members from the Helm community are active participants and leaders in the sigstore project
* Assets produced by the sigstore project are made available as [Helm charts](https://github.com/sigstore/helm-charts) for consumption within Kubernetes environments
* Helm is a registered type within the [Rekor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor) transparency log and a [Helm plugin](https://github.com/sigstore/helm-sigstore) simplifies the publishing and verification of signed charts
* Helm charts currently make use of GPG based tooling to [sign charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/provenance) and the Helm project is exploring offering alternate options, including tooling from the sigstore project
